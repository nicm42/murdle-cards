## General info

I love Murdle, but the cards have some annoyances. Here I am recreating them and fixing those annoyances.

Annoyances:

- Big cards not all being the same height
- Unable to use escape key to close big cards
- Unable to go to previous big card
- Unable to use arrows to go between big cards
