## General info

I love Murdle, but the cards have some annoyances. Here I am recreating them and fixing those annoyances.

Annoyances:

- When there are five cards, only having two per row
- Big cards not all being the same height
- Unable to use escape key to close big cards
- Unable to go to previous big card
- Unable to use arrows to go between big cards

Note: this will only display properly on a reasonably sized screen, since all of these annoyances relate to my experience with Murdle on a computer.
